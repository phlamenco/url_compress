##

a c++ implementation of paper: [In-memory URL Compression](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9bf1/007a376705f312ba37e4ea75cc56196d0361.pdf)

### build

mkdir build-dir && cd build-dir && cmake .. && make

### detail

the implementation pretty much follows the compression describe method in the paper with little difference.

there is no performance test for now and little test is supported which may suggest that bugs may exist.
